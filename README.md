# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-and-Prediction

Project Goals & Approach:

    Analyze Data: Use historical employee data (performance, history, satisfaction).
    Identify Drivers: Pinpoint what makes people leave (e.g., lack of development, low pay, poor work-life balance).
    Build Models: Develop machine learning models (like Decision Trees, Random Forest) for accurate prediction.
    Support Decisions: Enable HR to take action before employees quit. 

Key Factors Influencing Turnover:

    Career Development: Lack of growth opportunities is a major driver.
    Compensation & Benefits: Inadequate pay or raises.
    Work-Life Balance: Poor balance can lead to exits.
    Job Satisfaction: Intellectual challenge, meaningful work, & manager relations matter.
    Work Environment: Culture, workload, and management effectiveness. 

How ML Helps:

    Accuracy: Captures complex patterns traditional methods miss.
    Insight: Helps understand why people leave (interpretability).
    Proactive HR: Flags at-risk employees for targeted retention efforts (e.g., development plans, improved benefits). 

This project aligns with modern workforce analytics, using advanced techniques to turn data into actionable retention strategies, a significant step beyond basic HR metrics.
